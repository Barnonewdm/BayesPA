BayesPA
=======
This repository contains code for the following paper:

* Shi, Tianlin, and Jun Zhu. "Online Bayesian Passive-Aggressive Learning." Proceedings of The 31st International
Conference on Machine Learning. 2014.

Specifically, the code is a <b> streaming implementation of MedLDA </b>

<h2> What is MedLDA </h2>
<p> Maximum Entropy Discriminant LDA (MedLDA) is a max-margin supervised topic model. It <i>jointly trains Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) with SVM</i>, and obtains a topic representation more suitable for discriminative tasks such as
classification. </p>
